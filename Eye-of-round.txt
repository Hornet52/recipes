INGREDIENTS:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 large onions, sliced
12 (4 ounce) beef eye of round steaks
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/4 cup all-purpose flour for coating
1 cup beef consomme
1 cup Burgundy wine
1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley
DIRECTIONS:
1.	Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions; cook and stir until lightly browned and tender, about 5 minutes. Remove the onions from the skillet using a slotted spoon and set aside in a bowl. Season the steaks with thyme and seasoned salt, then dust them lightly with flour. Fry the steaks in the skillet over medium-high heat until browned on each side, about 5 minutes per side.
2.	Pour the red wine and beef consomme in with the beef. Return the cooked onions to the pan. Cook over medium-high heat until the aroma of wine dissipates, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1 hour. Serve steaks with the sauce and a garnish of fresh parsley.
